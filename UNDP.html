<h2>Committee Description</h2>

<p>The Palestine-Israel conflict is a complex and highly contentious issue that has its roots in religious, cultural, and political differences between Israelis and Palestinians. The conflict can be traced back to the late 1800s, when Jewish immigrants began moving to Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire, and later under British control.After World War II and the Holocaust, the United Nations voted in 1947 to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. However, this plan was rejected by the Arab states and led to the first Arab-Israeli War in 1948, which ended with Israel declaring independence and the neighbouring Arab states invading. This and subsequent wars resulted in Israel gaining control over large amounts of territory previously held by Palestinians, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The conflict has continued for decades, with both sides engaging in acts of violence and terrorism, as well as peace negotiations. Major events include the 1967 Six-Day War, in which Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the First and Second Intifadas, and the construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.Attempts at resolving the conflict have included the Oslo Accords in 1993, which established the Palestinian Authority and aimed at a two-state solution, and the Camp David Summit in 2000, which failed to produce a final peace agreement. The conflict remains unresolved, with ongoing violence, settlement expansion, and political tensions in the region.The Palestine-Israel conflict continues to be a major source of conflict in the Middle East and is a key issue in the wider Arab-Israeli conflict. The conflict is complex and deeply rooted, with numerous and interrelated political, economic, and social factors contributing to the ongoing tensions.</p>

    <h2>Director</h2>
    <p>Gordon Li</p>
    <p>Ever since Gordons first taste of the Model UN experience at a regional high school conference, he has realized the importance of having strong and comprehensive arguments which comes from cumbersome but necessary research. Outside of academics, he has a passion for athletics- he is an aspiring powerlifter and participates in Muay Thai spars. Hobbies of his include perfectionsitic (and completely impractical) note-taking, attending business case competitons and responsive web development. He and the rest of the secretariat are excited to host a memorable and academically driven Model UN conference here at Johnston Heights where delegates can ignite their passion for diplomacy and public speaking.</p>

    <h2>Chair</h2>
    <p>Rebecca Zhang</p>
    <p>Rebecca is currently a grade 11 IB student at Johnston Heights Secondary and is honored to be serving as chair of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) committee. She entered the world of Model UN in 9th grade and actually enjoyed the debate - much to her own surprise. Over the years her love and concern for international affairs and global politics have only grown, along with aspirations to pursue a career in law. Outside of Model UN, Rebecca can be found competitively swimming, or mass playing piano. She hopes that all delegates are as excited as she is in waiting for the conference, and is looking forward to meeting everyone!</p>
