<h2>Committee Description</h2>

<p>Historical Crisis Committee (HCC) is a committee that focuses on a past crisis rather than a current one. A key difference between HCC and other committees is that instead of playing the roles/delegations of countries, you take the role of historical figures and represent their wants, goals, and ideologies. This is what makes HCC is higher level committee where some past Model United Nations is strongly advised as expectations are higher.</p>

<p>The Berlin Crisis of 1961 was a pivotal period in history that showed how much compromise is needed for diplomacy. It occurred post WWII during the height of the cold war. The two primary powers in this conflict were the United States of America (USA) and the Soviet Union (USSR), with support from other powers such as the United Kingdom (UK) and France. It soon became a test of how much the USA would concede and how much the USSR would demand through ultimatums.</p>

<p>This committee takes place in what can be considered the peak of the crisis, where tensions were at an all-time high, and the West had to cut negotiations to maintain diplomacy. The Berlin wall prevented East Germans from seeking refuge in West Germany to escape communism. The USA had to choose between allowing the USSR to continue building the Berlin Wall or risking war to allow East Germans to immigrate to West Germany. The USSR frequently attempted to pressure the USA to withdraw their troops as Khrushchev (leader of the Soviet Union) saw how the West was easily swayed during the Vienna summit.</p>

    <h2>Chair</h2>
    <p>Grant Deng</p>
    <p>A student currently enrolled in the IB DP program at Johnston Heights secondary, Grant hopes to enjoy life to its fullest. However, this tends to become his way of shirking responsibility. He thinks that he has a sense of humor and always laughs at his own jokes, which, unfortunately are not funny to anybody else. He has engaged in a plethora of random extra-curriculars, and does not remember how he got into any of them. Nonetheless, MUN is something that he enjoys partaking in, particularly the lively, amusing and often quizzical debates.</p>
