         <h2>Secretary General</h2>
         <p>Krishna Verma</p>
         <p>Krishna Verma is a senior IB student at Johnston Heights Secondary School with an immense passion for
            debate. As a founder of the JHSSMUN club, Krishna has been running weekly meetings to help delegates prepare
            for upcoming conferences and practice their public-speaking skills. Krishna is dedicated to not only
            fostering a sense of global citizenship within the conference, but also to giving back to the community.
            Other than MUN, Krishna is an avid volunteer with GoodGuysBC, an organization dedicated to ending poverty as
            well as feeding the homeless in Downtown Eastside. Moreover, Krishna is heavily involved with the Wellness
            Initiative which is a charity organization that Krishna founded with the goal of helping better the
            community. Krishna is in every club you can imagine, thus, explaining his lack of free time. In his limited
            free time, Krishna is likely calling or hanging out with his friends, listening to music, playing games on
            his PS4 or watching sports. Krishna is jubilant to be the Secretary General and cannot wait for the
            first-ever JHSSMUN conference.</p>

         <h2>Director General</h2>
         <p>Irtaza Ahmad</p>
         <p>Irtaza Ahmad is a dedicated and driven individual with a passion for debating and Model United Nations
            conferences. His involvement in the leadership team of previous MUN conferences has allowed him to develop
            the skills and experience necessary to become the Director General for the upcoming Johnston Heights
            Secondary School MUN conference. In addition to his involvement in the MUN community, Irtaza is also
            actively involved in his local mosque and is always looking for ways to give back to his community. When
            he's not busy with MUN or community involvement, Irtaza can be found playing volleyball and staying active.
            He brings his strong work ethic and dedication to everything he does, making him a valuable member of any
            team. His enthusiasm and drive have led him to become a valuable asset to his community, and he is excited
            to continue growing and learning in his various roles and responsibilities.</p>

         <h2>Chief of Staff</h2>
         <p>Brian Soh</p>
         <p>As a senior IB Diploma Program student attending Johnston Heights Secondary School, Brian is beyond
            delighted to serve as the Chief of Staff for JHSSMUN 2023. Just a year ago, he was one of the founders of
            the Johnston Heights Model UN Club and has been coaching students of all grade levels in developing their
            soft skills and confidence for public speaking. His experiences in Model UN have been full of excitement and
            fruitful debate which he hopes to bring to the first iteration of JHSSMUN. In his rations of free time away
            from IB, he can be found training in martial arts as a 2nd Dan Black Belt or pondering “what if he hadn’t
            joined the IBDP?” Brian encourages all delegates, whether new or experienced, to actively participate in the
            discussions and negotiations at JHSSMUN 2023.</p>

         <h2>USG Chief of Committees</h2>
         <p>Oscar Chen</p>
         <p>A senior studying within Johnston Heights Secondary School’s IBDP program, Oscar is ecstatic to be serving
            as the USG Chief of Committees for the first-ever occurrence of JHSSMUN. Though he only began participation
            in Model UN last year, with most conferences being held online due to the pandemic, Oscar has garnered a
            multitude of experiences in various committees, leading to deep understandings of how committees function,
            and the necessities within a committee and its topic to promote fruitful debate. Oscar is certain that those
            who participate in JHSSMUN 2023 will discover fascinating committees, the allure of debate, and the same
            interest in diplomacy and teamwork that he has discovered through Model UN. When he is not studying, Oscar
            is often working as a lifeguard / coach at Surrey Sports and Leisure Complex, or he is scrolling through
            manga and webtoons on his phone. During the winter, he is often snowboarding at Cypress or Whistler. Oscar
            wishes that this February will bring forth the spirit of debate, the diplomatic skills of delegates, and
            deliver to all delegates a unique Model UN experience to last a lifetime.</p>

         <p>As a senior student at Johnston Heights Secondary, Devon is elated to participate in the first-ever Model UN
            conference at Johnston Heights! Though this is his first year delving into the world of diplomacy and
            international relations, he is eager to learn and grow through his experiences. Looking back on the car ride
            to his first ever conference while Daniel Caesar played in the back and ice caps in hand, Model UN is a
            memory that he will never forget. Devon looks forward to a rewarding and memorable experience at the first
            iteration of Johnston Heights Secondary School Model UN.</p>

         <p>Harsh is in his senior year at Johnston Heights Secondary School and has been selected to be the USG of
            Delegate Affairs for the first iteration of JHSSMUN. Within his experience being apart of the Model UN is
            just beginning, he is ecstatic to be apart of such an organization. Procrastination is an essential part of
            his life, and the bio you are reading right now is probably rushed. Though Harsh doesn’t have preference in
            the music he listens to, he refuses to listen to anything country. He hopes that anybody partaking in
            JHSSMUN this spring will have an excellent experience with the many diverse individuals and perspectives
            that are apart of such a prestigious event, and the memories made will be enough to reminisce till their
            next MUN event.</p>
